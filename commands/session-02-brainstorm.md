I want to brainstorm a spec for the current dev session.

Ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step spec for this idea. Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have a detailed specification I can hand off to a developer. Letâ€™s do this iteratively and dig into every relevant detail. Remember, only one question at a time.

Be sure to include questions about the testing requirements, approach, and scope. Also clarify the degree of production-readiness and polish that the task needs as many tasks are for early explorations or prototypes, whereas others may be for code to be deployed to production systems.

Once we are done, save the spec as spec.md

To kick things off, ask me what I'm intending to build.
