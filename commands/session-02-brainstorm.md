I want to brainstorm a spec for the current dev session.

**FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:**
Use only ASCII characters in all output, documentation, and code unless the content explicitly requires extended characters (e.g., user-provided strings, natural language content). Do not use Unicode emojis, fancy arrows, or decorative characters. CRITICAL: Never use curly/smart quotes (Unicode U+201C, U+201D, U+2018, U+2019) in any form - they prevent file editing and cause critical failures. Use plain ASCII alternatives:
- Use only straight ASCII quotes (U+0022) and apostrophes (U+0027)
- Use "->" instead of fancy arrows
- Use "*" or "-" for bullets instead of bullet characters
- Use "..." instead of ellipsis character
- No emojis (checkmark, X, celebration, etc.)

Ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step spec for this idea. Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have a detailed specification I can hand off to a developer. Letâ€™s do this iteratively and dig into every relevant detail. Remember, only one question at a time.

Be sure to include questions about the testing requirements, approach, and scope. Also clarify the degree of production-readiness and polish that the task needs as many tasks are for early explorations or prototypes, whereas others may be for code to be deployed to production systems.

Once we are done, save the spec as spec.md

IMPORTANT: First READ `spec.md` before writing, to prevent an error when writing it. (Expect an empty stub, raise to user if non-empty.)

To kick things off, ask me what I'm intending to build.
