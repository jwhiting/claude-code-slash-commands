I want to recapitulate the work for the current dev session.

There should be a directory of markdown documents and artifacts for the current
dev session. The name of the directory should be called
`docs/dev-sessions/$(date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H%M")-{slug}` where `$(date
+"%Y-%m-%d-%H%M")` is a bash command and `{slug}` is a short description of the
session. If you don't know the current dev session from context already, derive
the slug from the name of the current git branch, otherwise ask me to provide a
short description.

Read all the files in the dev session directory in full, especially the spec,
plan, and the phaseN-context docs. You might also want to look at git commit
history to be oriented on files changed, commit messages, and key diffs.

Then update these files:
- `recap.md` - a concise but thorough recap of what was done including problems
  encountered and their solutions (or lack thereof if applicable). This in
  essence combines all the phaseN-* documents into a single, compressed
  overview.
- `pr.md` - a concise, **humble** pull request description for this work,
  covering at least: the principle goal(s), new behaviors and key changes, new
  dependencies, breaking changes, concerns and remaining work to do,
  dependencies on other tasks, and anything else to help a developer quickly
  orient. avoid exaggeration and over-celebratory terms like 'comprehensive'
  and 'production ready' unless they are truly accurate and warranted from
  a critical review perspective. be neutral, accurate, concise, and helpful.

After writing these, commit your changes to git (local only, without pushing to
remote).
